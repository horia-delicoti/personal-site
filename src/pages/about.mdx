# About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Horia, a DevOps Engineer. I organize my notes and ideas on my **[wiki page](/docs/intro)** and share my **[projects](/projects/)** on **[GitHub](https://github.com/horia-delicoti)**. 

I write **[blog posts](/blog/)** to provide insights on Programming, Software Development, Linux, Networking, and CTF walkthroughs.

I am also interested in **[privacy](/docs/privacy)** and **[cybersecurity](/ctf/ctf)**.

I love Linux, Open-Source software, and Automation. I am sharing my **[dotfiles configurations](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/dotfiles)**.
I have a **[homelab](/docs/hardware/homelab)** where I host various services and experiment with new technologies, learn system administration, networking, security and privacy.
