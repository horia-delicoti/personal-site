# About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Horia. I like jotting down my notes and ideas on my **[wiki page](/docs/intro)** and sharing
my **[projects](/projects/)** on **[GitHub](https://github.com/horia-delicoti)**.

From time to time, I write **[blog posts](/blog/)** about programming, software development, Linux and networking.
I am also into **[privacy](/docs/privacy)** and **[cybersecurity](/docs/security/cybersecurity)**.

I enjoy tackling **[Capture The Flag (CTF)](/ctf/ctf)** challenges and post my **[CTF walkthroughs](/ctf/walkthroughs/)** to
share what I've learned along the way.

Linux, open-source, and automation are kind of my thing. If you're curious, you can check
my **[dotfiles configurations](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/dotfiles)**.

I also have a **[homelab](/docs/hardware/homelab)** where I host **[different services](https://github.com/horia-delicoti/infrastructure)**,
play around with new tech, and keep learning more about system administration, networking, security and privacy.
