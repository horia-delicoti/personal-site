title: Self-Hosting
---

**Self-hosting** is the practice of running software and services on your own hardware or infrastructure, rather than relying on third-party cloud providers. This approach gives you full control over your data, privacy, customization, and uptime, but also requires technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.

## üåü Why Self-Host?

- **Privacy:** Your data stays on your own hardware, not on someone else‚Äôs servers.
- **Control:** Full access to configuration, updates, and integrations.
- **Cost:** Avoid recurring subscription fees for SaaS products.
