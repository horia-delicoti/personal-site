**Cryptography** is the science and art of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, only reversible by authorized parties. It is foundational to modern security, enabling confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in digital systems.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

- **Plaintext:** Original, readable data.
- **Ciphertext:** Encrypted, unreadable data.
- **Encryption:** Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext using an algorithm and key.
- **Decryption:** Reversing ciphertext to plaintext using a key.
- **Key:** Secret value used in cryptographic algorithms (symmetric or asymmetric).
- **Algorithm:** Mathematical procedure for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES, RSA).

## 🔑 Types of Cryptography

### Symmetric Cryptography

- **Same key** for encryption and decryption.
- **Algorithms:** AES, DES, 3DES, ChaCha20, Blowfish.
- **Modes:** ECB, CBC, GCM, CTR, OFB.
- **Use Cases:** Disk encryption, VPNs, TLS bulk data.

### Asymmetric Cryptography (Public-Key)

- **Key pair:** Public key (shared), private key (kept secret).
- **Algorithms:** RSA, ECC (Curve25519, secp256k1), ElGamal, DSA.
- **Use Cases:** TLS handshakes, digital signatures, SSH, PGP.

### Hash Functions

- **One-way transformation**: No decryption possible.
- **Algorithms:** SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2, MD5 (obsolete), SHA-1 (obsolete).
- **Use Cases:** Password storage, data integrity, digital signatures.

### Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

- **Integrity and authenticity** using a secret key.
- **Algorithms:** HMAC (with SHA-2, SHA-3), CMAC.

### Digital Signatures

- **Non-repudiation and authenticity**: Sign with private key, verify with public key.
- **Algorithms:** RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519.

## 🧩 Protocols & Applications

- **TLS/SSL:** Secure web traffic (HTTPS), uses both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
- **SSH:** Secure remote shell, key-based authentication.
- **PGP/GPG:** Email and file encryption/signing.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens, signed (and optionally encrypted) for authentication.
- **Disk Encryption:** LUKS, BitLocker, FileVault.
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2.

---

## ⚙️ Cryptographic Primitives

- **Block Ciphers:** AES, DES, Blowfish (fixed-size blocks, various modes).
- **Stream Ciphers:** RC4 (obsolete), ChaCha20 (modern, secure).
- **Key Exchange:** Diffie-Hellman, ECDH.
- **Random Number Generation:** /dev/urandom, Fortuna, hardware RNGs.

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Key Management:** Secure generation, storage, rotation, and destruction of keys.
- **Entropy:** Use strong sources of randomness for key generation.
- **Side-Channel Attacks:** Timing, power analysis, electromagnetic leaks.
- **Padding Oracles:** Vulnerabilities in block cipher modes (e.g., CBC).
- **Algorithm Obsolescence:** Avoid MD5, SHA-1, RC4, DES.
- **Forward Secrecy:** Use ephemeral keys (e.g., ECDHE in TLS).

## 📝 Example: AES-GCM Encryption (Python, cryptography library)

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import os

key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=256)
aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
nonce = os.urandom(12)
data = b"secret message"
aad = b"authenticated but not encrypted"
ct = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, data, aad)
pt = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ct, aad)
```

## 📝 Notes

- Always use well-reviewed, up-to-date libraries and protocols.
- Never invent your own cryptographic algorithms.
- Understand threat models and choose primitives accordingly.
- Cryptography is only as strong as its weakest link—secure the whole system.
