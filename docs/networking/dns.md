title: DNS
---

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental component of the internet that translates human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS acts as the "phonebook" of the internet, enabling users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

## üß© How DNS Works

1. **User Request:** You enter a domain name in your browser.
2. **DNS Resolver:** The request goes to a DNS resolver, which queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address.
3. **Root, TLD, and Authoritative Servers:** The resolver may contact root servers, top-level domain (TLD) servers, and authoritative servers to resolve the name.
4. **Response:** The IP address is returned to your device, which then connects to the website.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common DNS Commands

```sh
nslookup           # Query DNS records for a domain
traceroute         # Trace the path packets take to a destination
dig                # Flexible DNS lookup utility
whois              # Lookup domain registration info
host               # Simple DNS lookup utility
```

## üìù Notes

- DNS is critical for internet usability and security.
- Using secure DNS (like DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS) helps protect privacy.
- Public DNS providers (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8, Quad9) offer alternatives to ISP DNS.
