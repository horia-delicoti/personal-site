[Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) is a network protocol for remote terminal connection. Although initially it was used for remote administration, we can use telnet to connect to any server listening on a TCP port number.

### Commands

```sh
telnet <HOST> <PORT>
telnet 10.10.10.34 7
```
