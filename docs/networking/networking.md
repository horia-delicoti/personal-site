title: Networking
---

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, exchange data, and enable communication. It forms the backbone of the internet, local area networks (LANs), and enterprise systems, allowing devices to interact efficiently and securely.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Network Types:**  
  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Connects devices within a limited area (e.g., home, office).
  - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects devices over large geographic areas (e.g., the internet).
  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or campus.
- **Protocols:**  
  - **TCP/IP:** Foundation of internet communication.
  - **Ethernet:** Standard for wired LANs.
  - **Wi-Fi:** Wireless networking standard.
  - **HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, DNS, DHCP:** Application and network layer protocols.
- **Devices:**  
  - **Router:** Directs data between networks.
  - **Switch:** Connects devices within a LAN.
  - **Hub:** Basic device for connecting multiple computers.
  - **Firewall:** Protects networks from unauthorized access.
- **IP Addressing:** Unique identifiers for devices on a network (IPv4, IPv6).
- **Subnetting:** Dividing a network into smaller segments for efficiency and security.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Networking Tools

- **Ping:** Test connectivity between devices.
- **Traceroute:** Track the path data takes to a destination.
- **nslookup/dig:** Query DNS records.
- **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer.
- **nmap:** Network scanning and security auditing.
