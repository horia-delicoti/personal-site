title: Home Assistant
---

**Home automation** is the integration of smart devices, sensors, and software to automate and remotely control household systems such as lighting, climate, security, entertainment, and appliances. At the heart of many DIY smart homes is [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), an open-source platform designed for privacy, flexibility, and local control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Home Assistant: Technical Overview

- **Core:** Written in Python 3, runs as a single process with async I/O for high concurrency.
- **Architecture:** Modular, with a core event bus, state machine, and YAML/GUI configuration.
- **Integrations:** 2500+ integrations for devices and services (Zigbee, Z-Wave, MQTT, REST, Modbus, etc.).
- **Automations:** YAML or UI-based, using triggers, conditions, and actions. Supports Jinja2 templating.
- **Add-ons:** Supervisor-managed Docker containers for extra services (e.g., Node-RED, Mosquitto, MariaDB).
- **Frontend:** React-based Lovelace UI, customizable dashboards, themes, and custom cards (via HACS).
- **APIs:** REST, WebSocket, MQTT, and native mobile app APIs.
- **Persistence:** Uses SQLite by default, supports MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL for larger installs.
- **Security:** Local-first, supports SSL, user authentication, and granular permissions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

- [Install Home Assistant OS on Raspberry Pi](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) or x86, NUC, VM, Docker, or supervised install.
- Add Zigbee/Z-Wave/MQTT controllers (e.g., [Conbee 2](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2)) for device integration.
- [Install HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites) for custom components, dashboards, and themes.

## üì¶ Key Components

- **Integrations:** Device and service connectors (Philips Hue, Sonos, Shelly, Tasmota, Zigbee2MQTT, etc.).
- **Automations & Scripts:**  
  - **Triggers:** Time, state, event, webhook, MQTT, etc.
  - **Conditions:** State, numeric, template, sun, zone, etc.
  - **Actions:** Service calls, notifications, scenes, scripts, delays, templates.
- **Entities:** Core abstraction for devices (sensors, switches, lights, covers, etc.).
- **Areas:** Logical grouping of devices (rooms, zones).
- **Scenes:** Predefined states for multiple devices (e.g., "Movie Night").
- **Dashboards:** Lovelace UI, custom cards, mobile-friendly, multi-user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

- **YAML Files:**  
  - `configuration.yaml` ‚Äî main config
  - `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`
- **UI Editor:** Visual configuration for automations, dashboards, integrations.
- **Custom Components:** Extend with Python, install via HACS or manually.
- **Themes:** Lovelace themes, custom CSS, dark/light modes.

## üè† Example Automation (YAML)

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on lights at sunset"
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunset
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.living_room
```
