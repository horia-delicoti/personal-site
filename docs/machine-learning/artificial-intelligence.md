## ü§ñ What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, language understanding, and problem-solving.

## üèõÔ∏è Main Branches of AI

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Deep Learning:** Subset of ML using neural networks with many layers.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language.
- **Computer Vision:** Interpreting and understanding visual information from the world.
- **Robotics:** Designing and controlling robots to perform tasks autonomously.
- **Expert Systems:** Rule-based systems that emulate decision-making abilities of human experts.
- **Planning & Optimization:** Algorithms for automated decision-making and resource allocation.
