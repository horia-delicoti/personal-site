[Capture the Flag (CTF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) in [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security) is an exercise in which participants attempt to find text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully [vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computer_security)) programs or websites.

These are my notes and resources for participating in CTFs or Hack the Box. I've also included people whose work has inspired me.
